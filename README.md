Blaz 1.1

Written by Matthieu Martel (matthieu.martel@univ-perp.fr)

Blaz is a library for frugal matrix computations. Blaz provides
compression/uncompression functions for matrices of floating-point
numbers and makes it possible to perform basic linear algebra on the
compressed matrices, without uncompressing them.

The interface is given in the file blaz.h
